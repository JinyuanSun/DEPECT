Understanding mutational effects on protein stability is of particular importance for creating industrially relevant biocatalysts. The degree of stability can be partially represented by ∆∆G or Tm. There are many methods to predict ∆∆G or arbitrary energy change form experimentally determined structure (FoldX, Rosetta, ABACUS… ). Traditional methods, like rosetta, are based on physical or statistical energy functions and stat-of-the-art (SOTA) methods achieved Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) about 0.5 ~ 0.7 and mean absolute error (MAE) about 0.7 ~ 1.6 on different tasks. This kind of methods are easy to explain and convincing also can be easily applied to various tasks. However, they are computation-resource consuming and requiring high quality structures (which might be solved by the AlphaFold2). 
This trending of ML has lasted for a decade and influenced biology significantly (Nanopore base calling). Some structure based ML models were developed to predict binary indicator of mutation effect and some progresses have been made on ∆∆G prediction.
